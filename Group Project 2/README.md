This folder contains the Python codes and report for the second (group) project. The dataset that our group chose to work on relates to the sales of anti-diabetic drug sales in Australia from 1992 to 2008, where observations are recorded on a per-monthly basis.
Our objective was to fit a model, so that we could perform forecasting. We attempted to fit an ARIMA model and a Holt-Winter's model, while also analyzing their behaviours.

We included the dataset here as _drug.txt_
