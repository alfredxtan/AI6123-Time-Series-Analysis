This folder consists of R codes and report for the final individual project. The choice of language was mediated by the need to perform more specialized analysis such as EACF and GARCH, which were absent in the statsmodels library.

The assignment consists of two parts --  the first part of the assignment consists of a few conceptual questions, including 
1. The explanation on whether a given, theoretical time series is weakly stationary
2. The transformation required to recover a stationary time series from a non-stationary one
3. The identification of different components (i.e., seasonality, trend, irregular) in a time series.
4. The transformation required to smooth out seasonal variation

The second part of the assignment requires us to perform analysis on Apple stock prices over the period of February 1, 2002 to January 31, 2017. Our objective was to fit the best model for forecasting.

We included the dataset for the second part here as _AAPL.csv_
